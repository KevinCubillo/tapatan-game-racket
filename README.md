# Tapatan Game-Racket

This is a Tapatan game created by Kevin Cubillo and Brandon Retana using Racket language and Big-bang library for the graphical interface.

## Game Description

Tapatan is a two-player strategy game played on a 3x3 board. The objective of the game is to form a line of three pieces of the same color vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Each player has a set of pieces and takes turns placing them on the board until one of them manages to form a line of three pieces.

The game starts with a window displaying the Tapatan board and a message saying "Key 1: Blue player starts, Key 2: Red player starts." Players can select which player starts by pressing the corresponding key. Once the starting player is chosen, players can begin placing their pieces on the board, taking turns.

If any of the players manage to form a line of three pieces, a message of "Player Red wins!" or "Player Blue wins!" will be displayed, depending on the winner. If the available pieces are exhausted and none of the players have formed a line of three, players are allowed to move the already placed pieces to empty cells in an attempt to form a line of three.
